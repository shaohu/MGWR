### How to start 
- You should be able to run the code with default conda environment. If not, try to create Python environment using [gmgwr_env.yml](gmgwr_env.yml) following [this](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) guide.
- As the first trial, run [mgwr/tests/main.py](mgwr/tests/main.py), see more at [mgwr/tests/README.md](mgwr/tests/README.md).  
  
### Structure 
- The core functions locate in [mgwr](mgwr)
- Some testing scripts and sample results locates [mgwr/tests](mgwr/tests)

### Benchmark 
https://github.com/pysal/mgwr/
- equal_interval() in search.py has bug. when running MGWR with .search(search_method="interval"), l_bound and u_bound is not correctly passed and get error TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'
- In this package, bw = 100 means a local regression with 100 neighboring points including itself. In Pro GWR, bw = 101 means 100 neighboring points + 1.
